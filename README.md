Nike Farms 
My Poultry Management System is one that helps the owner of poultry manage egg collection, sales and expenses on your poultry farm. You can also help your poultry flock with the help of this app.


The Web Management System

The Problem I am Solving
	The convenience my app offers will help in reducing the stress on documentation on paper every day.
	It ensures that Information concerning my client’s farm is secured and cannot be lost(unlike on paper which one can loss easily)
	It makes calculating profit/loss easy (by simply pressing a button), and it also saves my client’s the money they were meant to use to hire an accountant.
	It makes reference easier.
